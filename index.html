					<h3>Not everyone using online dating sites is looking for love</h3>
					<h2>What’s a Romance  Scam?</h2>

					<p>Romance scams can be very cruel. They play on peoples emotions and vulnerabilities. A romance scammer will build up trust by developing a convincing relationship with you, usually online. You may meet them on a dating site or on social media where they’ll be lurking behind an apparently genuine profile. Once the scammer has gained your trust, they’ll start asking you to send money, vouchers or gifts. 
					</p>

					<p>Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and will even find ways to get your personal details or passwords to access your bank account. They’ll invent reasons for needing money such as health issues, business issues or any other troubles they desperately need money to fix.</p>

					<p>Do not roll over and accept your fate, I understand it might look like you lost your money. You need to remember this money was stolen from you, not lost, and you have every right to demand this money back. In short, let me know when you have the money to get started. Let us fight for you, exercise your rights, and get this money back.  ke the right choice, sadly only a small percentage of victims take action and get their money back.

					<h2>You Need to Act Fast & Fight For Your Money</h2>
					<p>Giving up on your case is not a decision that is to be taken with a light head. You must understand that if no action is taken you will not get your money back. Taking action is not enough, a successful recovery requires acting in the right time frame, if an action is taken late, it generally affects the outcome of the case. To be clear if you do not take action in a relatively close time frame that the funds were stolen then fewer options/paths are available towards a recovery. How quickly you take action will also affect the time it will take to recover the funds because other options take longer...</p>

					<h2> Don't be embarrassed, Get Back Stolen Money</h2>
				<p>Online dating can be a great way to find lasting love – or even your next fling. But reports to the FTC suggest it also creates opportunities for scammers. In the past five years, people have reported losing a staggering $1.3 billion to romance scams,[1][2] more than any other FTC fraud category. The numbers have skyrocketed in recent years, and 2021 was no exception – reported losses hit a record $547 million for the year. That’s more than six times the reported losses in 2017 and a nearly 80% increase compared to 2020. The median individual reported loss in 2021 was $2,400 according by FTC.</p>
